## YouTube Captions

This is a project exploring the prevelance of captions on YouTube. How many top creators include non-generated captions on YouTube? Do certain types of creators include captions more frequently? How often do videos include more than one caption track?

BTW: I set up my scraping and starter analysis code to run automatically using Github Actions. If you're curious on how these work, check out the `.github` folder of this repo and [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions) for some more background.
