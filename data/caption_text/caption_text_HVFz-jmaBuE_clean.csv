"HVFz-jmaBuE","00:06:22","00:10:51","","winds and the rain start to die down and then the water will start to rise and that is overnight tonight into first thing in the morning futurecast into first thing in the morning futurecast 8 o'clock tonight pretty much our southern counties already in it this would be winds of 40 to 50 miles an hour gusts a little bit higher along the coast water will not be piling up yet water will not begin to push in until that center passes wherever you live east west latitudely so at this point if there's your center by about 10 o'clock tonight then you would start to see areas south of venice with that onshore flow everywhere else it's blowing out matter of fact remember with irma when all the water blew out of tampa bay it's not going to be like that this is a tropical storm or you know maybe even a minimal hurricane but the point is the water will be pushing away so we will not have a surge issue so then we go up to midnight and then that center is probably right about here so south of that bradenton sarasota siesta key you'll start to see that water come in it's still blowing out from pinellas and hillsboro pasco county north and then by two or three o'clock in the morning there's your center that's when i think we start worrying about the issues for surge if there's your center the rain is winding down still pretty gusty out there but the wind comes on shore so unfortunately that coincides with a high tide which is between about two o'clock and four o'clock in the morning depending on where you live again if you live inland this is not pertaining you this is only pertaining to the folks along the coast where that water could come in if you flooded in ada there's a decent chance you could flood again with elsa by four o'clock this morning there's your center so everywhere south of it is where that onshore flow will be coming in and spring hill inverness brooksville areas to the north it's still all pushing out and then by tomorrow morning it starts to accelerate north and landfall again it's kind of a moot point because there's really not a center to this thing but landfall will make somewhere around the big bend area and things will quickly wind down so that is your timing that's the way we see things playing out right now in terms of the spaghetti models at this point this one's almost useless we can take this one out of our show because we really don't even need spaghetti models anymore we kind of know where it's going the euro in terms of the winds the same thing about 40 to 50 miles an hour the gfs probably about the same thing you know at some point the gfs is a little bit low the global models typically don't do quite as well when you nail down a wind event at this point in time so i think more than anything the new things that we have seen in the last hour really in the last 20 minutes the addition of the hurricane warnings along the coast i've been really clear about that i do not anticipate hurricane conditions for most of our area but there will be a few spots that'll see gusts that high so you've got to be prepared for it better safe than sorry right tropical storm force winds the darker color that's where these warnings are not including polk county highlands harding de soto i will tell you i would not be shocked if those counties also see tropical storm force winds remember if they extend 70 miles out and your center's right about there that's about 60 miles maybe even less so i think even our inland counties are going to get some winds of about 40 to 45 miles an hour about it and again in terms of timing the orange color that's where the heaviest winds will be it's kind of brushing the sarasota coastline coming pretty much right into the tampa bay area overnight and then it begins notice the heaviest offshore which is what we're hoping but that's a 10 or 15 mile stretch either way in terms of where this storm is going tornado watch means conditions are favorable there's a meme out there and i think it's a great meme it's one where you see a tornado watching it shows all the tacos a tornado watching it shows all the tacos and they're not put together that's a watch but when all those ingredients are put together into one taco it becomes a warning that's the difference a watch means all the ingredients are out there for it to happen but it isn't happening now a warning means that it does and lastly rainfall totals maybe between about two and a half and four inches of rain as always is the case there will be more than that as we head on into some areas especially along the coast and also where the heaviest rains set up so now until whenever jason myself greg the rest of our abc action news team will be here kind of walking you through this step by step we get it it's a scary situation but if you've been prepared over the last few days and you're thinking i'm going to get 60 65 mile winds along the coast you might not be that far off maybe a bit higher but the preps will come in handy and we'll be here right on through the afternoon right onto the overnight to get you through this now let's head on back to lauren all right thank you"
