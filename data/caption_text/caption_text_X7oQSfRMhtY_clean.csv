"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:03:08","00:03:09","- Let's close it to each controllers.","so"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:03:09","00:03:11","So beyond that upfront,","beyond that up front you'll also notice"

"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:04:11","00:04:12","And there are certainly advantages to that.","and there are certainly advantages to that because if"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:04:12","00:04:14","Because if you go for a clean sheet of paper design,","you go for a clean sheet of paper design"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:04:15","00:04:15","you can incorporate things like, you know,","you can incorporate"

"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:05:57","00:05:57","it's super minimal.","super minimal"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:05:58","00:06:00","Like they have the little dock for it,","like they have the little dock for it which is it's"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:06:00","00:06:03","which is, it's nice Stand. this. Like, I like this.","a nice stand this like i like this yeah however"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:06:04","00:06:05","- However, one of X boxes,","one of xbox's"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:06:06","00:06:08","like really cool features is all the color ways","like really cool features is all the color"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:06:09","00:06:09","you can do with it.","ways you can do this yes"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:06:10","00:06:12","Like the creator lab is so cool.","like the the creator lab is so"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:06:13","00:06:16","Then if you have one of the battery packs,","cool but then if you have one of the packs those"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:06:17","00:06:17","those never match.","never match the"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:06:18","00:06:21","- These are most of the changes on the exterior","colorway these are most of the changes on the exterior of the series x"

"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:06:22","00:06:25","So new, slightly updated design,","new slightly updated design you"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:06:26","00:06:26","you have the much better D Pad.","have the much better d-pad"

"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:06:29","00:06:29","You have the USBC,","you have the usb-c"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:06:30","00:06:31","I guess we didn't mention that","i guess we didn't mention that it does have usb-c"

"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:06:41","00:06:44","it's nice that they all have Bluetooth now instead of,","it's nice that it they all have bluetooth now instead of you know like granite"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:06:44","00:06:47","like granted I think all of them before had like...","i think all of them beforehand like so the launch"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:06:47","00:06:50","- So the launch Xbox One controllers to this one,","xbox one controllers to this one so you can see you can see the difference"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:06:51","00:06:52","because it's actually the separate piece of plastic here.","because it's actually the separate piece of plastic here"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:06:53","00:06:55","This was a non Bluetooth controller cause it had this.","this was a non-bluetooth controller because it had this and you"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:06:56","00:06:56","And you also can tell because","also can tell because it doesn't have the"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:06:56","00:06:57","it doesn't have the headphones jack","headphones yeah"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:06:58","00:06:59","- Yes. Now we're dealing with the Microsoft, uh, wireless,","so not dealing with the microsoft uh wireless"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:07:00","00:07:02","wireless radio radio is great.","wireless radio radio is great especially when"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:07:02","00:07:05","Especially when they're trying to push game pass next cloud.","they're trying to push game pass the next cloud yeah so now"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:07:05","00:07:08","So now your one controller is compatible","your one controller is compatible with"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:07:08","00:07:11","with literally any device that you try and play X cloud on.","literally any device that you try and play xcloud on very"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:07:11","00:07:12","- Very good point.","good point yeah so you"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:07:13","00:07:13","So you can pair this with your phone,","can't pair this with your phone"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:07:14","00:07:16","with your iPad or whatever the case is.","with your ipad or whatever the case is now there is"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:07:16","00:07:19","Now there is another feature which you can't see,","another feature which you can't see and it's not really"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:07:19","00:07:20","and it's not really easy to test,","easy to test"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:07:21","00:07:23","but there's actual like improvements to the latency.","but there's actual like improvements to the latency"
"X7oQSfRMhtY","00:07:24","00:07:25","So this is something that they were talking to us about","so this is something that they were talking to us about"
