"452iQ8ttIcc","00:00:00","00:00:00","LINED UP WITH CARS, CELEBRATING, DANCING. PEOPLE HAVING A VERY GOOD TIME. JOE BIDEN WILL BE ABLE TO ENJOY  A CROWD IN A WAY HE HASN'T  REALLY THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE  CAMPAIGN. THIS IS A MOMENT THAT JOE BIDEN  HAS BEEN THINKING OF, WORKING  TOWARD FOR THREE DECADES. BUT IN MANY WAYS THE SPEECH THAT WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM HIM  TONIGHT WILL SOUND VERY  FAMILIAR. HITTING ON THE SAME THEMES WE'VE HEARD ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND  THROUGH HIS MANY DECADES OF  SERVICE. IT IS JUST THAT TONIGHT HE WILL  BE DELIVERING IT AS  PRESIDENT-ELECT. HE IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE  NEED FOR RECONCILIATION. HE RAN AS A CANDIDATE WHO CAN  HEAL THIS COUNTRY, LEAD THE  NATION FORWARD OUT OF WHAT HE  HAS DESCRIBED AS THE DARKNESS OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. AND TONIGHT THAT HEALING, THAT  WORK BEGINS RIGHT NOW. THAT IS WHY YOU ARE GOING TO  HEAR JOE BIDEN TONIGHT LIKELY  NOT ONLY TALKING TO HIS  SUPPORTERS HERE AND TO THE  RECORD BREAKING NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO BACKED HIM ACROSS THIS  COUNTRY BUT ALSO TO THE MORE  THAN 70 MILLION VOTERS WHO  SUPPORTED PRESIDENT TRUMP,  GEORGE.  >> YOU SEE THE SUPPORTERS IN  MASK AS JOE BIDEN WAS ALL  THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN MODELING  THE BEHAVIOR HE EXPECTED FROM  AMERICANS IN THE GRIP OF THIS  PANDEMIC. RIGHT NOW, DAVID MUIR, WHAT  WE'RE SEEING TONIGHT THAT HAS  BEEN MISSING FROM THE CAMPAIGN  TRAIL SO MUCH THIS YEAR, PURE  JOY. >> JOY AND A REMINDER OF WHAT  WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS PAST  YEAR. NO MATTER WHAT SIDE YOU'RE ON IN THIS POLITICAL CAMPAIGN AND NOW  THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION  CLEAR. AMERICA HAS LIVED THROUGH A  PANDEMIC THIS YEAR, LIVED  THROUGH A CONVERSATION ON RACIAL JUSTICE LONG OVERDUE IN THIS  COUNTRY, AND HAS LIVED THROUGH  THE POLITICAL FIGHTING AND YOU  SENSE THAT IN JOE BIDEN'S  VICTORY, HELPED FUELED BY  INDEPENDENTS, SOME REPUBLICANS  HE WAS ABLE TO PULL ON TO HIS  SIDE, THE MIDWEST, THE SOUTH. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE WEST  FOR JOE BIDEN. THAT PERHAPS, PERHAPS THIS  COUNTRY IS READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE  THAT WE CAN HAVE DIFFERENT  OPINIONS, DIFFERENT POLITICAL  VIEWS, BUT WE CAN STILL RESPECT  ONE ANOTHER AND TREAT EACH OTHER WITH KINDNESS AND HE'LL SHARE  THE STAGE TONIGHT. THIS IS A BIG DEAL, GEORGE, AS  YOU KNOW. HE'LL SHARE THE STAGE WITH A  WOMAN WHO WILL MAKE HISTORY,  KAMALA HARRIS, AS VICE  PRESIDENT, WHO WILL SPEAK TO THE NATION TONIGHT AS WELL. >> FIRST TIME AS VICE  PRESIDENT-ELECT TODAY. LINSEY DAVIS A DAY OF JOY BUT SO MANY CHALLENGES AHEAD. >> SO MANY CHALLENGES AHEAD. FIRST WE'LL GO WITH THE REVELERS WE SEE ON THE SCREEN, THAT  SCRAPPY KID FROM SCRANTON WHO  GREW UP WITH A BIT OF A STUTTER  TO BECOME THE NEXT PRESIDENT AND THAT IS WHAT SET THIS JUBILATION REALLY IN CITIES ACROSS THE  COUNTRY. GLOBAL LEADERS STARTED SENDING  THEIR CONGRATULATIONS. THE MAYOR OF PARIS TWEETED  WELCOME BACK, AMERICA. THE MAYOR OF LONDON. IT'S TIME TO GET BACK TO  BUILDING BRIDGES NOT WALLS. YET AS YOU SAY THERE IS SO MUCH  STILL TO SORT OUT MOVING  FORWARD. MORE THAN 70 MILLION AMERICANS  VOTED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP SO HOW DOES THE COUNTRY UNIFY? >> THERE ARE SOME THINGS, SOME  REMINDERS THAT THE ERA WE ARE IN IS NOT PAST. PRESIDENT TRUMP BACK ON TWITTER  TONIGHT NOT ACCEPTING THE  RESULTS OF THIS ELECTION MAKING  MORE FALSE CLAIMS. >> NOT AT ALL, GEORGE. USUALLY AT A MOMENT LIKE THIS  YOU EXPECT THE LOSING CANDIDATE  TO MAKE A PHONE CALL TO THE  PRESIDENT-ELECT TO GIVE A  CONCESSION SPEECH THAT WOULD  COME IN ADVANCE OF A VICTORY  SPEECH. THERE'S BEEN NO PHONE CALL FROM  THE PRESIDENT. THERE'S BEEN NO HINT OF  CONCEDING THIS RACE. HE IS VERY MUCH DISPUTING IT. HE IS ACTUALLY ON TWITTER  CLAIMING HE NOT JUST WON THIS  ELECTION BUT HE WON BY A LOT. OF COURSE HE LOST THE POPULAR  VOTE BY MORE THAN 4 MILLION  VOTES. AND HE'S CHALLENGING, THERE ARE  LEGAL CHALLENGES BUT HE WOULD  HAVE TO OVERTURN THE RESULTS,  GEORGE, AND NOT IN ONE STATE,  NOT TWO STATES, BUT THREE STATES AND, YET, STILL DEFIANT AS EVER  ON TWITTER. >> NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. AS WE SEE THE CELEBRATIONS IN  WILMINGTON AND WE SAW ACROSS  MANY CITIES IN AMERICA TODAY  PEOPLE SPONTANEOUSLY COMING TO  THE STREETS, A REMINDER THAT  EVEN THOUGH JOE BIDEN IS BY NO  MEANS AN ACTIVIST POLITICIAN HE  WAS BROUGHT INTO OFFICE ON A  WAVE OF ACTIVISM BEGINNING ON  PRESIDENT TRUMP'S INAUGURATION  DAY.  >> THAT'S RIGHT. I WANT TO JOIN LINSEY AND  EVERYBODY ELSE AND JUST TAKING A MINUTE, YOU KNOW, LIKE TODAY I  WAS WALKING THE STREETS IN NEW  YORK AND WATCHING PEOPLE CHEER  AND ALL OF MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES  IN THE MOVEMENT WE ALL SAID,  TODAY WE CELEBRATE. TOMORROW WE GET BACK TO WORK. LIKE WE WERE JUST ALL ENJOYING. PART OF IT IS BECAUSE WE KNOW  THAT THE PRESIDENT WE HAD BEFORE WAS SO DIFFICULT, SO IMPOSSIBLE  AND AT LEAST THE ONE WE'VE GOT  WE FEEL LIKE WE CAN HAVE A  CONVERSATION WITH. WE ALL WORKED TOGETHER AND  FOUGHT TOGETHER AND USED OUR  RESO RESOURCES AND HE WILL BE OUR  PRESIDENT AND WE'RE READY. >> AT LEAST 71 MILLION PEOPLE  VOTED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. MANY OF HIS SUPPORTERS ARE  DISAPPOINTED AND ANGRY AND DON'T BELIEVE THE RESULTS. YOU ALSO HEARD TODAY FROM YOUR  FELLOW REPUBLICANS READY FOR  CHANGE AS WELL.  >> ONE THING I WAS REALLY STRUCK BY WAS MY SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS  WHICH ARE FILLED WITH FORMER  COLLEAGUES AND PEERS WHO WORKED  FOR PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH,  JEB BUSH, MITT ROMNEY, THE LATE  JOHN McCAIN. MANY OF THEM GENUINELY  CELEBRATING. I LOOK AT THESE EXIT POLL  RESULTS AND JOE BIDEN GOT 8% OF  REPUBLICANS. THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A LOT  BUT IN RACE THAT IS GOING TO BE  DECIDED PROBABLY BY ABOUT A  HUNDRED THOUSAND VOTES IN A FEW  STATES JUST THINK. IF DONALD TRUMP COULD HAVE  EXTENDED AN OLIVE BRANCH MANY OF THOSE PASSIONATE SUPPORTERS OF  THOSE INDIVIDUALS PERHAPS WOULD  HAVE GOTTEN BEHIND HIM AND MADE  A DIFFERENCE. >> ONE THING THAT WILL BE A  CHALLENGE FOR THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION IS DO YOU WANT  THIS TRANSACTIONAL OR  TRANSFORMATIONAL IN THE WAY THE  REAGAN DEMOCRATS CHANGED THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY. THEY'LL BE CONSCIOUS BECAUSE OF  THE DYNAMICS THEY HAVE TO DEAL  WITH. AND THE OTHER CHALLENGE JOE  BIDEN WILL HAVE AND I READ THIS  PIECE REALLY INDICATIVE, AT ""THE WASHINGTON POST,"" WHICH IS HE IS BOTH A RESTORATIVE PRESIDENT AND A TRANSFORMATIONAL PRESIDENT. THOSE ARE WHO DIFFERENT IMPULSES AND ALL OF US SEE DIFFERENT  THINGS WE WANT TO SEE IN JOE  BIDEN AND THEN PROJECT THAT ON  TO HIM. PART WILL BE RESTORATION. LIKE OH, MY GOD, WHICH IS WHAT  PEOPLE ARE FEELING. AND THEN TRANSFORMATIONAL TO A  DIFFERENT ERA BECAUSE AMERICA IS DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS WHEN JOE  BIDEN FIRST GOT INVOLVED IN  POLITICS. >> WE'RE SEEING THE MOTORCADE  ARRIVE NOW AT THE CHASE CENTER  IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE JUST A  SHORT TIME FROM THE  PRESIDENT-ELECT'S HOME. CHRIS CHRISTIE, YOU'VE KNOWN JOE BIDEN FOR A LONG TIME. YOU'VE KNOWN DONALD TRUMP FOR A  LONG TIME. IT DOESN'T APPEAR THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE THE KIND OF TRADITIONAL  TRANSITION YOU WOULD EXPECT  BETWEEN PRESIDENTS. >> IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT AT  THIS POINT BUT WE HAVE TO WAIT  AND SEE. THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO FOLLOW THE LEGAL COURSE HE WANTS TO  FOLLOW. I THINK IT IS A VERY TOUGH  COURSE GIVEN THE MATH. >> HE CAN'T OVERTURN FOUR  STATES. >> LIKE I SAID AS A LAWYER I  LOOK AT IT AND I DON'T KNOW HOW  YOU DO IT BUT IF HE WANTS TO  PURSUE IT, IT IS HIS RIGHT TO DO THAT AND LET HIM GO AHEAD AND DO IT. I DON'T THINK THEY'LL HAVE THE  TRADITIONAL TYPE OF TRANSITION. BUT MAYBE IF WE GET TO THE END  OF THAT PROCESS THE PRESIDENT  WILL SEE IT WOULD BE THE RIGHT  THING TO DO ONCE HE HAD BEEN  ACQUITTED IN TERMS OF ALL OF HIS RIGHTS HAVE BEEN ACQUITTED TO  PURSUE IT. I WANT TO SAY ONE THING ABOUT  JOE BIDEN. YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT JUST LIKE  POLITICAL ACQUAINTANCES. WE SAT AT FOOTBALL GAMES  TOGETHER AT OUR JOINT ALMA MATER THE UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE MANY  SATURDAYS. OUR BOXES WERE RIGHT NEAR WEECH  OTHER WHERE WE SAT WITH OUR  FRIENDS AND HE IS A REALLY GOOD  PERSON AND WE HAD A LOT OF FUN  TOGETHER DESPITE OUR POLITICAL  DIFFERENCES OVER THE YEARS OF  OPINION WE'D SIT DOWN AT THOSE  GAMES AND ENJOY BEING THERE AND  ENJOY EACH OTHER'S COMPANY. THAT IS A REALLY GOOD PERSON TO  HAVE IN THE POSITION HE IS IN  NOW. >> IN THE END, THAT'S WHAT  WORKED FOR HIM. >> THAT IS WHAT WORKED FOR HIM. BECAUSE WE ARE ABOUT TO WITNESS  ONE OF THE MOST DRAMATIC SHIFTS  IN TONE OUT OF THE PRESIDENCY  THAT WE'VE EVER HAD FROM A  MEGAWATT REALITY TELEVISION  SUPERSTAR, THE NUMBER ONE RATED  SHOW IN TELEVISION FOR YEARS, TO A LOQUACIOUS BUT QUIETER MAN  FROM DELAWARE. AND HIS ABILITY REALLY IN HIS  LIFE TO REACH ACROSS THE AISLE  AND TO JUST BE HIMSELF AS MUCH  AS HE SEEMS TO BE. I THINK IT WAS HIS CALLING CARD  FOR A LOT OF VOTERS. THEY TRUST THAT WHAT THEY'RE  GETTING IS WHAT THEY SEE AND  WHAT THEY SEE IS WHAT THEY WANT  AFTER THE REALITY STUFF. >> MARTHA RADDATZ A FRIEND  POINTED OUT TO ME AND I GUESS IT WAS FITTING THERE WAS A  BREEDERS' CUP RACE TODAY THE  WINNER OF THE BREEDERS' CUP,  AUTHENTIC. >> YEAH. I THINK HE IS AUTHENTIC. I'M THINKING OF WHAT HE DID ON  TUESDAY. HE WENT TO THE GRAVE SITE OF HIS SON BEAU. AND YOU HAVE TO THINK HE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT BEAU TODAY. CERTAINLY HIS FIRST WIFE AS WELL AND HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER WHO WERE  KILLED BUT BEAU REALLY PROPELLED HIM TO THIS MOMENT. HE SAID HE THOUGHT BEAU BIDEN  SHOULD BE PRESIDENT SOME DAY,  FIVE YEARS AGO OF COURSE. HE LOST HIS SON BEAU TO BRAIN  CANCER. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE  REASONS CERTAINLY HE DIDN'T RUN  IN 2016 BECAUSE HE WAS STILL  GRIEVING. THAT GRIEF HAS BROUGHT HIM TO  THIS DAY AND MADE HIM IN PART  THE MAN HE IS TODAY AND THE  EMPATHY HE SHOWS TO SO MANY  PEOPLE. AND THE WORLD IS LOOKING AT THIS RIGHT NOW, GEORGE, THE WORLD  WHICH SAW AMERICA FIRST POLICIES UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP ESPECIALLY OUR ALLIES ARE LOOKING TO THIS  MOMENT. LINSEY POINTED OUT THE MAYOR OF  LONDON SAYING IT'S TIME TO BUILD BRIDGES AGAIN. I THINK OUR ALLIES ARE THINKING  THAT TONIGHT HE'S HAD MANY  CONGRATULATORY E-MAILS, TWEETS,  AND OTHER THINGS TO JOE BIDEN  BECAUSE THEY SEE THE WORLD  CHANGING UNDER JOE BIDEN. >> MARTHA RADDATZ, THANK YOU. WE'RE WATCHING THE CROWD IN  WILMINGTON IN THE MIDST OF THE  CROWD IN WASHINGTON THAT FORMED  IMMEDIATELY AFTER THIS  ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE. >> ABSOLUTELY, GEORGE. RIGHT AWAY PEOPLE WERE RUNNING  TO THIS AREA. THIS HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST DANCE  PARTY IN WASHINGTON, D.C. I'VE GOT TO SAY. IT'S BEEN GOING ON ALL DAY LONG  ALL THE WAY UP SEVERAL, SEVERAL  BLOCKS ALL THE WAY CLOSE TO THE  WHITE HOUSE. IN FACT, WE HAVE A CAMERA THAT  IS JUST ABOVE THE ROOF TOPS  THERE. I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT THE  CROWD LOOKS LIKE RIGHT NOW. YOU SEE ST. JOHN'S CHURCH. THIS IS OF COURSE BLACK LIVES  MATTER PLAZA. THIS IS WHERE WE SAW THOSE  PROTESTS IN THE SUMMER. WE REMEMBER THAT TEAR GAS THAT  WAS USED HERE. SO FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE  OUT HERE, THIS IS VERY SYMBOLIC  FOR THEM TO BE DOING THIS HERE,  TO BE CELEBRATING THIS HERE ON  THIS NIGHT, GEORGE. >> GIO BENITEZ, THANKS. RACHEL SCOTT, IT WAS THE VOTERS  OF PHILADELPHIA WHO PUT JOE  BIDEN OVER THE TOP. >> IT WAS. IT WAS THE VOTERS OF  PHILADELPHIA AND PENNSYLVANIA A  PLACE THAT WAS THE BIRTHPLACE OF OUR DEMOCRACY. A DEMOCRACY THAT QUITE FRANKLY  NEVER CREATED ITS SPACE FOR  SOMEONE LIKE KAMALA HARRIS TO  ASSUME THE POSITION OF VICE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  SO TONIGHT FOR SO MANY, AND IT  IS IN PENNSYLVANIA, A PLACE THAT HAS HELPED DEFINE OUR NATION'S  HISTORY, IS ONCE AGAIN CHANGING  THE COURSE OF IT, GEORGE. >> LINSEY DAVIS, I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS TODAY. WE SAW THAT GREAT EIGHT SECOND  VIDEO OF KAMALA HARRIS TODAY  WHEN SHE WAS CONGRATULATING JOE  BIDEN BECOMING PRESIDENT OF THE  UNITED STATES AND BECAUSE THIS  WAS SUCH AN UNTRADITIONAL  CAMPAIGN EVEN THOUGH SHE HAD HER MOMENT AT THE CONVENTION SHE  REALLY DIDN'T GET THE CHANCE TO  CAMPAIGN AND INTRODUCE HERSELF  TO THE COUNTRY THE WAY MOST VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WOULD  DO. TONIGHT IS THE NIGHT  >> I THINK TONIGHT PEOPLE ARE  GOING TO MEET HER FOR THE FIRST  TIME OUTSIDE OF THE DEBATES I  THINK AND HER, YOU KNOW,  REPUTATION AS BEING THIS SKILLED DEBATER FROM HER TIME AS BEING  AN ATTORNEY GENERAL. AGAIN, DURING HER TIME IN THE  SENATE WHEN SHE WAS ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS DURING SOME OF THE  HEARINGS SO I THINK PEOPLE  BEYOND THAT STILL NEED TO KIND  OF GET A SENSE OF WHO SHE TRIED  TO INTRODUCE HERSELF AS DURING  THE CONVENTION AS MAMALA AND THE SOFTER SIDE AND WE GOT TO KNOW  HER THROUGH HER SISTER AND HER  STEP DAUGHTER AND HER NIECE AS  WELL. AND SO I'M VERY INTERESTED TO  HEAR WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY  TONIGHT. >> LET'S SHARE THAT HAVE YOU HAD YO FROM THIS AFTERNOON. >> WE DID IT, WE DID IT, JOE. YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE NEXT  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. >> SHE WAS SPEAKING TO THE TWO  OF THEM BUT THAT WE IS BIGGER  THAN JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA  HARRIS. >> OH, GEORGE, WITHOUT QUESTION  IT IS. WHEN I, LOOKING AT KAMALA HARRIS AND LISTENING TO HER I CAN SEE  AND HEAR SHIRLEY CHISOLM. SHE WAS THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN THIS  COUNTRY IN 1974 AND, GEORGE, SHE ONCE SAID IF THEY DON'T GIVE US  A SEAT AT THE TABLE BRING THE  FOLDING CHAIR. I THINK OF ALL THE WOMEN OF  COLOR WHO BROUGHT THEIR OWN  FOLDING CHAIRS OVER THE YEARS TO CREATE THIS MOMENT FOR KAMALA  HARRIS. WOMEN LIKE HARRIET TUBMAN,  FANNIE LOU HAMER WHO ONCE SAID  NEVER FORGET WHERE YOU CAME FROM BUT ALWAYS PRAISE THE BRIDGES  THAT CARRIED YOU OVER. I IMAGINE TONIGHT WHEN KAMALA  HARRIS SPEAKS SHE WILL SPEAK OF  SOME OF THE BRIDGES WHO CARRIED  HER TO THIS MOMENT. JUST LOOK AT THESE IMAGES. THIS IS FOOTBALL SEASON. THIS LOOKS LIKE FRIDAY NIGHT IN  AMERICA AFTER YOUR FAVORITE TEAM JUST WON THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP. HOW WONDERFUL FOR OUR NATION IN  THIS DIVIDED TIME TO HAVE A  NIGHT LIKE THIS WHERE PEOPLE  SEEM JOYOUS AT LEAST FOR AN  EVENING. >> MARY BRUCE, YOU'RE RIGHT IN  THE MIDDLE OF IT. >> WHAT ALSO STRIKES ME ABOUT  THIS CROWD AND WE'VE BEEN  WALKING AROUND A LITTLE BIT  TONIGHT IS THE DIVERSITY OF THIS CROWD. YOU SPEAK ABOUT WHAT THIS MOMENT MEANS FOR WOMEN AND FOR YOUNG  GIRLS AND THERE ARE A LOT OF  THEM HERE TONIGHT. SEEING SO MANY YOUNG WOMEN,  LITTLE GIRLS, LITTLE BLACK AND  BROWN GIRLS WEARING THEIR KAMALA HARRIS/JOE BIDEN T-SHIRTS WAVING THOSE AMERICAN FLAGS. FOR THE FIRST TIME TONIGHT THEY  WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK UP AT THAT  STAGE AND SEE SOMEONE WHO LOOKS  LIKE THEM. WHAT A POWERFUL MOMENT FOR  EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY  REGARDLESS OF POLITICS. IT IS JUST SO STRIKING IN THE  MIDST OF THIS PANDEMIC AS  SOMEONE WHO HAS COVERED EVERY  TWUFT AND TURN OF THIS CAMPAIGN, IT IS A LITTLE SURREAL TO BE AT  WHAT FEELS VERY MUCH LIKE A  CAMPAIGN RALLY JUST BECAUSE WE  HAVEN'T SEEN THIS. JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN EXTREMELY  CAUTIOUS THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE  CAMPAIGN TO ONLY HOLD RELATIVELY SMALL, SOCIALLY DISTANCED  EVENTS. THEY ARE TRYING THEIR BEST TO  MAKE SURE THIS IS SOCIALLY  DISTANCED. YOU CAN SEE THE CROWD IS  STARTING TO FILL IN A LITTLE  BIT. EVERYONE THOUGH IN THOSE MASKS  FOLLOWING THE GUIDELINES AS MUCH AS THEY CAN. IT IS JUST A MOMENT. IT IS A MOMENT FOR KAMALA HARRIS AND FOR JOE BIDEN TO BE ABLE TO  LOOK OUT AND SEE A THRONG OF  SUPPORTERS IN A WAY THEY REALLY  HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE  THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN, GEORGE. >> THIS IS A MOMENT, TOO, FOR  HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND  UNIVERSITIES, KAMALA HARRIS THE  GRADUATE OF HOWARD UNIVERSITY. >> IT'S QUIET HERE RIGHT NOW BUT THE SENSE OF PRIDE ON THE  CAMPUS, THIS HVC, HISTORICALLY  BLACK COLLEGE RIGHT NOW IS  INDESCRIBABLE. THIS IS A UNIVERSITY THAT WAS  ESTABLISHED IN A TIME WHEN BLACK PEOPLE DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO  EDUCATION IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS  ERA AND THE JIM CROW ERA. NOW YOU HAVE AN ALUMNI FROM THIS UNIVERSITY HEADING TO THE SECOND HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND THE  GROUP WAS HERE EARLIER ON  CAMPUS. THEY WERE GATHERED HERE, HER  SORORITY SISTERS. THEY'VE HELPED HER CAMPAIGN  ALONG THIS ENTIRE TIME. THEY'VE DONATED TO HER CAMPAIGN, ORGANIZED EFFORTS TO GET PEOPLE  TO POLLING PLACES, AND RIGHT NOW AT THIS UNIVERSITY THEY RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING THAT A NEW  DAWN HAS BROKEN ON CAMPUS AND  KAMALA HARRIS HAS SWUNG THE  HOWARD HAMMER AND SHATTERED THAT GLASS CEILING THAT IS NOW IN  PIECES AND CAN NEVER BE PUT BACK TOGETHER. THERE ARE A LOT OF YOUNG, BLACK  KIDS HERE, YOUNG, BLACK MEN AND  WOMEN ON THIS CAMPUS WHO ARE  PROUD OF WHAT SHE HAS ACHIEVED. WE TALKED TO SEVERAL THIS  EVENING AND THEY ARE PROUD TO  WATCH HER WALK INTO THE WHITE  HOUSE NOT AS A SLAVE NOT AS A  SERVANT BUT IN THE SECOND  HUGHEST  HIGHEST OFFICE IN THIS NATION. >> THANK YOU. YOU COVER THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT. THERE WAS SO MUCH CONCERN ABOUT  HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE FBI IN THE DAYS LEADING TO THIS  CAMPAIGN ABOUT VIOLENCE IN THE  STREETS. AT LEAST FOR TONIGHT AT LEAST  RIGHT NOW THAT IS NO T WHAT WE'E SEEING.  >> WASHINGTON IS FULL OF JOY  TONIGHT. I SAW SO MANY HONKING HORNS AS I CAME IN, GEORGE, QUITE  REMARKABLE SEEING PEOPLE HAVING  JOY IN THE STREETS EVEN IN THE  BLACK LIVES MATTER PLAZA WHERE  THERE WAS SO MUCH TENSION AND  UNREST THIS SUMMER. AS YOU LOOK AT THE JOY, WE ALSO  KNOW THAT BIDEN AND HARRIS WILL  FACE ENORMOUS CHALLENGES IN THE  DAYS AHEAD. AFRICAN AMERICANS WILL BE  WANTING ACCOUNTABILITY. RIGHT NOW IN THIS COUNTRY WE'VE  SEEN THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN  SOME JURISDICTIONS ARE FIVE TO  TEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE  ARRESTED, OFTEN PULLED OVER AT A RATE DOUBLE THEIR WHITE  COUNTERPARTS. SO AS THE JOY RECEDES TONIGHT  THERE IS A LOT OF WORK AHEAD,  GEORGE. >> SO THIS WAS A DIFFICULT ISSUE FOR JOE BIDEN TO STRADDLE IN THE CAMPAIGN. HE GREW UP IN A DIFFERENT TIME  AND HIS RECORD ON CRIMINAL  JUSTICE ISSUES WAS OFTEN A CAUSE OF CONCERN IN THE BLACK  COMMUNITY. >> HE DIDN'T QUITE GET THAT  RIGHT UNTIL THE END. I REMEMBER HE WAS DOING A TOWN  HALL WITH YOU AND IT WAS SORT OF THE FIRST TIME HE EVER  ACKNOWLEDGED THAT MAYBE HIS  ACTION IN 1994 WITH THE CRIME  BILL WASN'T THE BEST THING AND  THAT MAYBE HE SHOULD HAVE DONE  IT DIFFERENTLY. SO I HOPE HE GETS IT RIGHT. I THINK HE WILL. I THINK WITH KAMALA HARRIS WITH  HIM I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO GET IT RIGHT AND I WAS ACTUALLY  REFLECTING WITH TERRY EARLIER  THE FACT THAT THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION BROUGHT FOLKS  FROM FERGUSON INTO THE WHITE  HOUSE AND STARTED TO BUILD THE  BEGINNINGS OF THIS WORK. SO MY HOPE IS THAT HE WILL PICK  THAT UP, AND NOW UNFORTUNATELY  WE HAVE MORE NAMES TO SAY, MORE  ACTIVISTS, MORE PARENTS BECAUSE  THERE'S BEEN SO MANY MURDERS  SINCE FERGUSON THAT WE CAN ALSO  BRING TO THE TABLE. ONE OF THE HOPEFUL POINTS THAT I HAVE ABOUT JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA  HARRIS IS I HOPE THEY TAKE THIS  EARLY TIME TO BRING REAL PEOPLE  IN, TO BRING THEM AROUND THE  TABLE WITH PROBLEM SOLVERS AND  ACTUALLY LET THEM BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. THAT IS ONE EXAMPLE FROM THE  OBAMA/BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WHERE THEY GOT IT RIGHT. >> HE HAS BEEN VERY CONSISTENT  ON THE PANDEMIC AND IN REENTS  DAYS FILLING THE VACUUM AS  AMERICA WAITED FOR RESULTS FROM  THE ELECTION WHEN HE CAME OUT TO SPEAK HE WOULD TALK ABOUT THE  PANDEMIC FIRST AND NOT THE  MOMENTUM HIS CAMPAIGN WAS  FEELING THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE  PRESIDENT-ELECT. THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY MET  WITH THE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE. WHEN I SAT DOWN WITH BOTH OF  THEM, JOE BIDEN AND SENATOR  HARRIS, THEY BOTH TALKED ABOUT  THE PANDEMIC. SENATOR HARRIS SAID WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE WHEN THERE IS A SAFE  VACCINE IT IS NOT THE PEOPLE WHO GET IT MOST EASILY THAT SHOULD  GET IT FIRST. IT SHOULD BE THE FRONT LINE  WORKERS AND FAMILIES AND  COMMUNITIES THAT WOULDN'T HAVE  ACCESS NECESSARILY. YOU KNOW, JOE BIDEN PICKED  KAMALA HARRIS NOT ONLY FOR THE  DIVERSITY AND HISTORY MAKING  THAT WILL COME WITH THAT CHOICE  BUT BECAUSE HE KNEW SHE COULD  TAKE THE INCOMING FIRE THAT  COMES BY BEING A FIRST. BY MAKING HISTORY ON THIS STAGE  TODAY. HER BACKGROUND AS A PROSECUTOR. SHE IS TOUGH. AND HE KNOWS SHE IS UP FOR THE  JOB.  >> NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. RAHM EMANUEL HAS TO GET TO WORK  ON THIS PANDEMIC EVEN BEFORE  HE'S PRESIDENT. >> HE ALSO JUST NAMED A TASK  FORCE OR SOME OF THE NAMES ARE  OUT. SO FIRST OF ALL YOU HAVE TO  THINK OF GETTING THE PANDEMIC  BOTH THE PUBLIC HEALTH SIDE, THE VACCINE, ETCETERA. IT'S THE FIRST DOMINO OF A  SERIES. YOU CAN'T GET TO THE ECONOMY. YOU CAN'T GET TO OTHER PIECES  UNTIL YOU GET YOUR HANDS AROUND  A PROBLEM THAT IS NOW TOTALLY  RAGING OUT OF CONTROL. THEY'LL BE DOING THIS ON A VERY  KIND OF SUCCINT MANNER OF GOING  AT EACH ONE OF THESE THINGS BUT  THE FIRST AND FOREMOST, AND I  REMEMBER THIS STORY DURING THE  ADMINISTRATION PRESIDENT BUSH  HELPED US BY KICKING THE AUTO  INDUSTRY OUT SEVEN TO EIGHT  WEEKS, ALLOWED US TO GET THE  STIMULUS AND TASK FORCE IN PLACE SO WE COULD HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE BUT THE FIRST DOMINO IN ANY  PIECE AND IT IS DEPENDENT ON  THIS IS GETTING BASICALLY YOUR  ARMS AROUND -- TODAY 120,000 NEW CASES A DAY. IT IS NOW TRIPLED IN JUST A  MONTH. GETTING YOUR HAND AROUND THAT  AND PUTTING THIS BACK IN THE BAG ALLOWS THE ECONOMY TO TAKE ITS  OWN HEALING AREA AND THEN A  GROWTH STRATEGY BEHIND THAT. >> IT IS GOING TO REQUIRE HIM  CHRIS CHRISTIE CALLING IN YOUR  FORMER COLLEAGUES GOVERNORS  ACROSS THE COUNTRY, REPUBLICANS  AND DEMOCRATS. >> YEAH. I THINK THE REPUBLICANS AND  DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS WILL ALL BE ANXIOUS TO WORK AND MAKE SURE  THAT WHAT THEY DO IS GET THE  HELP THEY NEED FOR THEIR STATES  AND SOME STRONG DIRECTION. THAT'S WHAT THE GOVERNORS WANT. THEY'VE BEEN HANDLING THIS I  THINK IN THE MAIN THE GOVERNORS  HAVE BEEN HANDLING THIS PRETTY  WELL AND YOU CAN SEE AROUND THE  COUNTRY THE APPROVAL RATINGS OF  GOVERNORS REGARDLESS OF PARTY IN STATES, LARRY HOGAN ABOVE 70% IN MARYLAND. YOU HAVE ANDREW CUOMO IN THE  SAME RANGE IN NEW YORK. SO THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE. >> THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY HERE. IT IS THE OPPORTUNITY DONALD  TRUMP MISSED. IN A DIVIDED AMERICA WE HAVE TO  FIND WHAT WE HAVE IN COMMON AND  WORK ON IT TOGETHER AND  OBVIOUSLY WE'VE GOT THIS  PANDEMIC IN COMMON. AND BIDEN SPEAKS THE LANGUAGE OF TEAM WORK VERY NATURALLY. IT'S REALLY WHO HE IS. HE TALKS ABOUT THE REASON WE  WEAR MASKS IS FOR EACH OTHER. TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER. HE HAS A NATURAL APPEAL TO  PUTTING OUR SHOULDERS TO THE  WHEEL AGAINST A COMMON PROBLEM. THAT'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO  DIVIDE FOR DONALD TRUMP. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR JOE  BIDEN TO, THE FIRST THING HE'S  GOT TO DO, WHICH IS FIND WHAT WE HAVE IN COMMON AND WORK ON IT  TOGETHER.  >> AND IN SOME WAYS LOW HANGING  FRUIT. YOU HAVE A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WHO SAY YEAH WE WANT TO WEAR  MASKS. THERE COULD BE SOME REGIONAL  DIFFERENCES BUT THE MAJORITY OF  AMERICANS SAY YEAH IT KIND OF  MAKES SENSE. I DON'T ALWAYS LIKE DOING IT BUT IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. >> THE ONE PLACE CONSISTENTLY  REPUBLICANS FOUND SOME  DIFFERENCE WITH THE PRESIDENT,  PRESIDENT TRUMP, WAS ON THE  VIRUS. SO WHEN YOU SAY LOW HANGING  FRUIT, IT IS BOTH IN THE SENSE  SIMPLE THINGS YOU CAN DO BUT  ALSO A PLACE WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO WORK WITH THE NEW INCOMING  PRESIDENT. >> DO YOU THINK THAT THERE CAN  BE A CRITICAL MASS OF  REPUBLICANS IN WASHINGTON READY  TO SIGN ON TO AT LEAST SOME OF  THE BIDEN AGENDA ON THE  PANDEMIC? >> YES. CERTAINLY STIMULUS. WE'VE BEEN THERE FOR A LONG  TIME. NOW THE PARTIES OBVIOUSLY  DISAGREE ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY  SHOULD BE PROVIDED BUT EVEN IF  JOE BIDEN ACCEPTED WHAT  REPUBLICANS WANT IT IS $2  TRILLION. IT'S A LOT OF MONEY THAT CAN DO  A LOT OF THINGS FOR PEOPLE. THEY WILL HAVE TO MEET IN THE  MIDDLE. I THINK REPUBLICANS LIKE  DEMOCRATS ARE EXHAUSTED. AND NOBODY GOES TO WASHINGTON  AND WANTS TO FIGHT. THEY WANT TO DO THINGS. THEY WANT TO HAVE CEREMONIES  BACK IN THEIR DISTRICTS TALKING  ABOUT, YOU KNOW, GOOD THINGS  THEY'VE DONE. YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY BEEN SOME OF THAT IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS BUT  THERE'S JUST A LOT OF, A LOT OF  CONFLICT. AND I THINK REPUBLICANS WILL BE  HAPPY TO HAVE JOE BIDEN TO WORK  WITH ASSUMING JOE BIDEN  RECOGNIZES THAT THERE ARE MANY,  THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE TONIGHT  WHO ARE JUST AS DISAPPOINTED AS  THERE ARE PEOPLE JUBILANT IN THE STREETS. >> THIS IS ONE OF THOSE DEALS  WHERE YOU CAN SAY THE GLOBAL  NUMBER IS ""X"" BUT WE'RE GOING TO SPEND IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY. THAT IS HOW YOU BASICALLY MEET  HALF WAY. THE REPUBLICANS SAY OKAY. $2 TRILLION. SAY THAT IS THE STIMULUS NUMBER  BUT BIDEN IS GOING TO SAY THIS  IS HOW I WANT TO DIVIDE IT. I WANT MORE STATE AND LOCAL AND  THEY SAY OKAY. THAT IS HOW YOU BASICALLY CUT A  DEAL ON THIS.  >> ONE THING I THINK REPUBLICANS TO BUILD UP WHAT WAS SAID  EARLIER WHERE HE CAN FIND COMMON GROUND IS ON FURTHER CRIMINAL  JUSTICE REFORM. >> YES. >> A LOT OF REPUBLICANS  SUPPORTED CRIMINAL JUSTICE  REFORM THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP  PASSED AND A LOT OF DEMOCRATS  DID. AND I THINK THERE IS AN  ACKNOWLEDGMENT IN BOTH PARTIES  THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT OUR  CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE AND MAKE IT  FAIRER. YOU SAW THAT IN THE CRIMINAL  JUSTICE REFORM PASSED IN THE  LAST COUPLE YEARS AND I THINK IT IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE YOU KNOW,  REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS CAN  COME TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY  ALREADY HAVE. AND THEY'VE SEEN SOME OF THE  POSITIVE RESULTS FROM THAT. >> I THINK MARTHA RADDATZ IF  THAT HAPPENS IN WASHINGTON  PERHAPS A LOT OF IT BEHIND THE  SCENES, ALL THE EXHAUSTION  AMERICANS HAVE FELT OVER THE  LAST FEW YEARS WILL GO AWAY  BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY  ATTENTION TO EVERYTHING GOING ON EVERY SINGLE MINUTE OF THE DAY  IN WASHINGTON. >> THAT'S RIGHT. IT IS EXHAUSTING. IT IS EXHAUSTING FOR THE  COUNTRY. IT CERTAINLY IS EXHAUSTING FOR  US. YOU KNOW, TONIGHT, GEORGE, I  ACTUALLY WALKED DOWN TO THE  WHITE HOUSE AS WELL TO SORT OF  SEE WHAT THAT WAS LIKE DOWN  THERE BUT IT PROMPTED ME TO CALL SOME PEOPLE IN TEXAS IN A VERY  TRUMP TOWN, HONEY GROVE, TEXAS  AND TALK TO CARL WILD THERE A  FORMER TRUMP SUPPORTER WHO SAID  IT'S JUST VERY QUIET THERE. PEOPLE ARE ACCEPTING IT. THEY'RE NOT REALLY LISTENING TO  WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS SAYING AND  NOT SAYING. IN OTHER WORDS, CONCEDING. BUT HE SAID THIS IS DEMOCRACY AT WORK. IT IS DEMOCRACY AT WORK. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING. >> PLEASE WELCOME THE","[Applause]"
