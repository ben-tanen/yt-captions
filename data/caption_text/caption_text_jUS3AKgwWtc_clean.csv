"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:05:56","00:05:58","which meters the gas flow into your machine.","so i'm just gonna open it up then we've got this"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:05:59","00:06:00","I've got to set it about 30 CFMs","pressure regulator here which meters the"

"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:06:03","00:06:04","That's kind of standard-ish for MIG welding","about 30 cfm's"

"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:06:06","00:06:07","And this machine is super easy to set.","that's kind of standard"

"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:13:22","00:13:24","I still wanna try to make this test a little bit","okay so with our boost creep"

"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:13:29","00:13:32","try to match that boost creep with our tune","i just put the cap back on and now what we're going to"

"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:13:36","00:13:39","So then we can at least see how much power we make","try to put the same amount of boost through the cat on"

"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:13:51","00:13:53","(upbeat music)","make sense"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:13:54","00:14:03","","i hope so"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:06","00:14:08","And we're looking at our boost map here again","all right so we"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:06","00:14:09","And we're looking at our boost map here again","just got done retesting"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:09","00:14:11","and you can see our original boost line","with the cat and we're looking at"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:11","00:14:12","that we were kind of chasing,","our boost map here again"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:13","00:14:14","that magenta line is in there somewhere,","and you can see our original"

"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:15","00:14:17","just buried by all these other boost lines","we were kind of chasing that magenta line is"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:17","00:14:20","because we did a really good job of mimicking that boost,","in there somewhere just buried by all these"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:18","00:14:21","because we did a really good job of mimicking that boost,","other boost lines because we"

"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:22","00:14:25","So, once we did that and we retested the cat","mimicking that boost that boost creep that we"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:25","00:14:27","the numbers that we got are as follows,","were having so once we did that"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:28","00:14:31","we have 252.8 horsepower on average with the cat","we retested the cat the numbers that we got are as follows we have"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:31","00:14:34","and 210.1 foot pounds of torque on average.","252.8 horsepower on average with the cat"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:35","00:14:35","Then with the test pipe,","and"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:36","00:14:39","we managed 257.7 horsepower on average","210.1 foot-pounds of torque on average then with the test pipe"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:40","00:14:43","and 217.2 foot pounds of torque on average.","we manage 257.7 horsepower on average"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:44","00:14:46","That means we picked up 4.9 horsepower","and 217.2 foot-pounds of torque"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:46","00:14:49","and 7.1 foot pounds of torque with the test pipe.","on average that means we picked up 4.9"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:50","00:14:50","","horsepower and 7.1"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:51","00:14:53","Not too shabby. Its certainly not those 30 horsepower","foot-pounds of torque with the test pipe"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:54","00:14:55","that we were seeing in difference.","not too shabby"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:55","00:14:57","But with our boost creep issues taken into account,","it's certainly not those 30 horsepower"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:55","00:14:58","But with our boost creep issues taken into account,","that we were seeing in"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:14:58","00:15:01","I think this, is a pretty valid test","difference but uh with our boost creep issues taken into account"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:15:01","00:15:02","as far as tests go.","i think this"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:15:02","00:15:03","as far as tests go.","this is"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:15:03","00:15:05","well, we sort of did it.","a pretty valid test as as"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:15:05","00:15:06","We made a test pipe.","far as tests"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:15:06","00:15:07","That was pretty cool.","go well"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:15:07","00:15:08","We put it on the Miata","we sort"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:15:09","00:15:11","and we definitely made way more power with it.","of did it we made a test pipe that was pretty cool we"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:15:11","00:15:14","Now I'm not too happy with the way that we made the power.","put it on the miata and we definitely made way more power"
"jUS3AKgwWtc","00:15:14","00:15:17","I think we've got some issues like we talked about.","with it now i'm not too happy with the way that we made"
