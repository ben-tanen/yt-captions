"WLY_hwrG08Y","00:00:00","00:02:25","","in the 2021 nfl draft the jacksonville jaguars select trevor lawrence quarterback clemson and so the inevitable has finally become reality family friends dog they're all happy for trevor lawrence the new jacksonville jaguar it's a new era of jacksonville jaguars football this is a prototype player can make every throw and as good as he is on the field he's even better off the field with all of his intangibles get a chance to see what he does here how about let's start with accuracy look at how small this window is and where he fits this football that's like putting a football in a mailbox that's the accuracy you see from trevor lawrence how about the vision quickly being able to see the middle of the field vacated replace it with a dime down the field for a home run ball to amari rogers down here in the red area under pressure got a little bit of a whiff block by your right tackle hang in there and deliver a strike as a freshman in the national championship game can you get away from pressure you're going to see this at the next level no problem climb up to the left and deliver a strike across your body working against the north carolina tar heels and then this was the big one this changed the game watch the sideline after this run this changed the momentum in this game running away from the ohio state defense you saw the momentum swing towards clemson at that moment this kid has been on the big stage his whole life and this is not going to be too big for him there's no question about it i think you hit that last one there as big for me he's just not he's not just athletic this guy is fast this guy can run this guy can outrun people and joe clatt hit on it i don't think they talked about enough this guy is tough and when you want to win over a football team you went over the offensive line first and he's going to win those guys over day one he is tough he will stand in there he will take a hit he will pop up we've seen this guy come off the bench and come out of the locker room after getting checked out and take over again that's those things the big guys love to see that we always play the comparison game when we talk about these guys and your guy coach andrew luck is one of the guys he's compared to and rightly so one of the comparisons i use with it is another guy who wore 16 that's joe montana not necessarily in stature but in how they go about their business and how cold-blooded they are on the field you talk about that competitiveness that joel clap brought up when i talked with someone from his camp lawrence's camp they did mention joe montana was a model"

WE ARE ","draft the cincinnati bengals select jamar chase wide receiver lsu okay so the bengals go ahead and get joe barrow his old college team made back getting the band back together and figure out how to protect burrow with another pick for another day daniel does this surprise you i thought it was it was going to come down to the wires of coinflip we should get the house banned to sing reunited and it feels so good for joe burrow joe burrow was at his best at lsu and they went empty they had weapons all over the field you saw it with justin jefferson so jamar chase and paris marshall now with the bengals joe burrell is going to have tyler boyd t higgins and now this is a true number one wide out in jamar chase they're going to be able to get guys out and joe burrow can get the ball out of his hand and what it also says is that this is a deep tackle clap and they feel like they can come back at the top of the second round and get a tackle if indeed they want don't forget jonah williams is already there from alabama he hasn't played that much but they draft him to be a tackle coach shaw but i love this choice another huge weapon getting faster in that division and trying to put some pressure on some of those tough defenses in the afc north and daniel hit it right on the head too this quarterback loves to be spread out give this guy weapons all over the place now you offset some of the pressure he could face from the baltimore ravens etc they're going to load up the box this guy and as soon as i put this young man's film on i wrote down 80 catches for a thousand yards that's the first thing i'm watching this guy run over people run around people run through people run through contact whether you're trying to press them down the field 50 50 balls they're not 50 50. i just wrote down 80 catches for a thousand yards we're gonna hear from chase in a second but the dolphins are on the clock and you have to sit here and think it's part of that 49ers trade from 12 all the way to three and the dolphins moving down then back up to six that they would have hoped that pitts or chase would be there and there's four minutes on the clock with justin fields still on the board and matt jones on the board you have to wonder what might be going on behind the scenes in miami as we continue talking about chase a little bit yeah maybe miami ends up making a third trade here before they pick but jamar chase he is such a physical and competitive player and for a six foot wide receiver he can go up and get it play above the rim and i i love anquan bolton i don't say that lightly he has that type of competitive fire in his belly when the ball is in his hand and now he's reunited look when you go back and watch that 2019 season think about how good justin jefferson has been in the nfl this dude was even better on that 2019 tape so we know it's going to translate well and joe burrow has got to be pumped right now with the sixth pick in the 2021 nfl draft the miami dolphins select jalen waddle wide receiver alabama so joe burrow gets reunited with his fellow alum now tua gets jalen waddle so back to back choices are made here in the nfl draft reuniting college teammates building a little bit of a track team down there in miami too when you bring over will fuller in free agency when you bring over will fuller in free agency now you add the most explosive and the fastest wide receiver in this year's draft that's not my opinion that's what the gps numbers all these teams have been working off of tell them this is rare rare juice and explosiveness with jalen waddle and i do think that familiarity with tua is gonna help him get off to a quick start it's a great compliment to what they already have isn't it when you think about devonta parker preston williams gaseki the tight end now you get that guy really explodes dave i i had my comparison as santana moss i know we were together with the ravens we saw santana moss a little bit that's what he reminds me of not only as a receiver but a phenomenal returner even in the recruiting world when i talk to receivers they tell them the receiver's got three jobs number one change field position number two score points and number three get people out of their seats this guy is going to do all three and he's going to do them very very quickly so jalen waddle getting the hug from uh commissioner roger goodell devonte commissioner roger goodell devonte smith as we know the heisman trophy winner is still available but the detroit lions have just made their selection the carolina panthers are now on the clock well you saw it on the graphic there i've referenced spaceballs this kid's got ludicrous speed it's a different level you can throw on these quick little bubbles that's from his quarterback to a taco by law they're going to be reunited they don't even get a hand on him there at texas a m how about double coverage he was the one with all the production earlier in the season before he got hurt it wasn't devante smith they're bracketing him in this missouri game he runs right through the bracket how about double moves you take the cheese on him it is over safety takes it he's gone has to slow up for the ball a little bit it doesn't matter because he gets right back up to top speed and he runs away from everybody on the field you're never going to see this kid get caught it just doesn't happen on the tape now he had an ankle injury and forced to miss the majority of the season he won over a lot of teams when he came back after that injury could have walked away from the team and got ready for the draft was hobbled but still played in that national championship game one to be out there with his guys first of all i love this baseball reference that was awesome but the quickness and explosion cannot be underestimated there are a lot of fast guys they have fast guys that are fast without the ball in their hands they're fast before they catch it this guy is fast before he catches it this guy is fast after he catches it sometimes looks like even faster he gets the ball in his hands and he goes even faster and he runs it reminds me like a dion sanders he just runs faster than the guys catching him if there's a faster guy catching him he just runs a little bit faster i'm glad you acknowledged his baseball's there coach but i don't understand we keep saying reunited there's no peaches at herb yet but anyway how about what we're gonna see now the pieces of the puzzle that he gets added to to and now quarterback that he gets added to to and now quarterback no one looking over his shoulder quarterback no one looking over his shoulder gaskins had a nice year last year devonta parker was a thousand yard receiver two seasons ago we know will fuller can fly if he can stay healthy now you had jalen waddle to it as well so they're getting faster and chasing"

HOW ABOUT  ","in the 2021 nfl draft the denver broncos select pat certain junior [Applause] so patrick certain has just had his own football dream realized that's a name familiar to a lot of nfl fans of his father's play for many years in the nfl he's gonna have his hands full with wide receivers from kansas city and las vegas and of course los angeles coming his way twice a year but what a nice moment for patrick certain to have as he becomes the second alabama crimson tide player off the board you know this just hit me i had a conversation with vic fangio two years ago we've talked a lot throughout the years he told me one thing it used to be you have to have a pass rusher to make those corners better he said it's a new world you have to have corners down the ball comes out too quick these quarterbacks are too good these receivers are too fast in order to play really really good defense you have to have a stopper out there on the island so this makes a lot of sense for him so that's the choice of the denver broncos so that's the choice of the denver broncos meaning the cowboys are on the clock they were hoping for one of the corners clock they were hoping for one of the corners named certain they're too clean and they're gone the corners were too clean they were gonna go with jc horn and pat certain just there's in a year where there's a lot of uncertainty that's about as certain as it gets in this draft quick follow-up to what coach shaw said sure go back a couple of years when denzel ward came off the board and bradley chubb was still available they ended up going to denver and being the pass rusher but they took denzel ward because of the coverage that coach shaw was just talking right here in cleveland we look at we look at this player guys he's so explosive you saw it in the testing ran a 4-4-1 he jumped 39 inches he can play in any scheme you know he's been coached great by his father as well as coach saban there at alabama he's got outstanding length and ball skills down the field as well so when you watch him just like jc horn you see him going up against the best competition he saw it here in the sec you see the long arms to get on you at the line of scrimmage mcfangio wants to play some press man certain is very comfortable getting up there throwing his hands and rerouting how about out on an island just leave him alone out there and feel confident and comfortable the toughness no doubt about that he'll fill he'll he'll show up and run support get underneath this notre dame ball carrier get him on the ground this is somebody also has the ability not only to tackle you can match him up with tight ends he can do so many different things you see him trigger you try and block him with a tight end he goes right through him to get to the ball carrier he has toughness i go back to those baltimore raven days coach and we always felt like they have a great defense you had to have not just good corners tough corners this is a tough kid that's going to"

"WLY_hwrG08Y","00:26:06","00:28:24","","with the tenth pick in the 2021 nfl draft the philadelphia eagles select devonta smith wide receiver alabama [Applause] so it is in fact a reunion tour tonight joe burrow reunited with his wide receiving target jamar chase from lsu and then later on tua the next pick reunited with jalen waddle his target from alabama days in miami and now jalen hurts who is atop the depth chart in philadelphia gets the heisman trophy winner davonte smith as his target very comfortable with him and somebody that is so silky smooth when you watch him he's the best route runner in this year's draft there might be receivers that are rated higher than him but nobody creates separation like he does which is going to create some easy throws for his former and new teammate and jalen hurts yeah what i love about this pick is when you add it with philadelphia we keep talking about jalen rhaegar last year he was beat up for all but the rest of the guys travis fulcrum had to emerge for them watkins john hightower this is an absolute home run pick for philadelphia when we go and look at his tape again i talk about him as a route runner also once the ball is in his hands you see guys don't touch him to catch a ball that's such an easy throw he literally does not get touched on his way to the end zone at the top of the route he's got a little bit of that savvy and oh to our guy michael irvin just a little nudge there to create a little extra separation little extra separation he can win over the top on fate balls you see him win against sean wade from ohio state just runs away from him tracks it easy and then he's got a huge catch radius you see it here against notre dame you saw the crazy one hand catch he made in the back of the end zone for alabama i know eagles fans were frustrated last year that they passed on justin jefferson in my opinion they got it right this year with devonta smith he is a number one wide receiver and i think philadelphia is going to be a big fan of this guy and i love the fact he can rock that number six no double digits put that same number six you rocked at alabama and take it to"
