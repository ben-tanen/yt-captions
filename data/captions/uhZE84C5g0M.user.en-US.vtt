00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.040
- Hey Brooklyn.

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.970
My name's Matt.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.710
I'm 26 and I'm super excited to meet you

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.007
and go paddle boarding with you tonight.

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:10.174
(lively guitar music)

00:00:13.258 --> 00:00:14.091
- Okay guys, I'm headed
to date number four.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.037
I just finished doing my makeup

00:00:18.037 --> 00:00:20.750
but honestly I think I'm
gonna have to rebraid this

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.160
'cause it's kind of a mess

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.130
but date number four guys.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.120
I'm almost halfway there.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.090
This is so crazy.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.370
It's so insane how every day is different.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.630
Like every guy is different.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.070
I'm so excited about today's date

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.280
cause it's gonna be really fun.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.140
I don't know much about the guy but yeah.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.650
Also, I'm wearing,

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.483
I don't know if you can see

00:00:37.483 --> 00:00:40.080
that I'm wearing like this
little giraffe print swimsuit

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.930
which is the first time

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.460
I've ever worn giraffe print swimsuit.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.870
So if this guy doesn't
appreciate my cute suit,

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.830
you guys can appreciate my cute suit.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.900
I haven't really been on a
lot of water dates before

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.680
which made me have to sit there

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.020
and think like, "Do I put makeup on?"

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.270
'Cause normally if I'm
going swimming and stuff,

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.210
like if I'm in the water,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.850
I'm the kind of person that
will like legitimately swim.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.010
I will like legitimately paddle board,

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.843
do all those things.

00:01:03.843 --> 00:01:05.257
So like my first thought process is like,

00:01:05.257 --> 00:01:06.300
"Oh, I'm not gonna wear makeup

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.480
cause I don't want it to get everywhere."

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.490
But usually I can put on some extra store

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.550
and it stays on pretty well.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.220
But if I'm doing stuff like surfing,

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.000
I'll just not wear makeup

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.790
but this is also a date.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.623
So like...

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.740
So I'm just putting on like light makeup

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.610
for all these water dates, we'll see.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.780
Date number four here we come.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.020
We're going back up the
Canyon for this date.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.520
I know that this guy's name is Matthew.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.230
He's 26 and he--

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.250
- Wait, he referred to himself as Matt.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.060
Just bear in thought.
- Oh sorry, Matt.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.940
I don't know if he's
training to be a pilot

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.010
or is a pilot.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.700
Kind of funny because I come
from fifth generation pilots,

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.630
like my grandpa--

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.690
- Oh my gosh, guess what he is!

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.540
He's a twin.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.373
- Oh yeah!

00:01:44.373 --> 00:01:45.810
And we don't know if
he's identical or not.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.660
So that'll be kind of a fun talking point

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.120
'cause not everybody can relate to that.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.420
We are actually, again,
running late (laughs).

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.200
We literally I've been in
traffic every single day.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.470
We've been in like construction.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.060
- And we've been leaving earlier too.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.893
- Yeah, we have been.

00:01:58.893 --> 00:02:00.710
We've been leaving like 45
minutes early for every day.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.600
So, do not judge us,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.433
we're doing our best.

00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:03.787
I saw a few of y'all that were like,

00:02:03.787 --> 00:02:05.010
"How old would you actually date?"

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.030
I think the parameters I set
for this were like 21 to 28.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.030
Honestly, I'm kind of
open minded about age.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.980
I think if you just get along really well,

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:12.813
it's all good.

00:02:12.813 --> 00:02:13.646
So this guy is 26

00:02:13.646 --> 00:02:14.640
and I'm really pumped

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.363
and we'll see how it goes.

00:02:17.593 --> 00:02:18.870
- That's why I hopped out.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.992
Hey!
- Nice to meet you.

00:02:19.992 --> 00:02:21.220
It's like a nice evening weather

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.640
so it's actually perfect outside

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.880
so I'm kind of pumped.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.240
- [Betsy] Yeah, it is very beautiful.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.090
- Yeah, it's really pretty.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.570
And the view is always gorgeous.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.186
- [Betsy] I mean, look at this.

00:02:29.186 --> 00:02:30.840
(wind whirls)
(gentle music)

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.680
All right, let's show the
cute little basket you have

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.513
for the picnic.

00:02:33.513 --> 00:02:36.705
- This is the picnic basket.
- Oh, there's stuff in it.

00:02:36.705 --> 00:02:38.410
It's so cute.
- Some salad and some chips

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.341
and stuff, yeah.
- [Betsy] Awesome.

00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:42.760
(gentle upbeat music)

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.870
- [Brooklyn] What are you doing
for like job, your career?

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.370
What are you like pursuing?

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.470
- So I am in flight school right now.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.790
I'm training to be a pilot.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.070
So I wanna be a commercial pilot.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.968
- [Brooklyn] And you have a twin brother?

00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:58.170
I do have a twin.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.833
- [Brooklyn] And your fraternal, right?

00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:02.030
- Fraternal, we look nothing alike

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.360
so sometimes people can
like tell the difference.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.290
Sometimes it's hard for people
to believe that we're twins.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.730
- [Brooklyn] Yeah, I get that.
- I meant to say (chuckles).

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:11.702
- [Brooklyn] I get that.

00:03:11.702 --> 00:03:14.869
(gentle upbeat music)

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.890
Oh, I just, zoomed in.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.970
Okay, I just finished eating my meal.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.930
I know you guys are gonna laugh
at me that this is finished

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:24.880
but this is finished.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.330
I don't know if he cooked it himself

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.470
but he's not here

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.860
but I'm impressed if he
did cause it was delicious.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.460
And also he has this like
cute little setup of fruit

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.880
and he even brought lemons
to squeeze over the salad.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.550
So it was like really bougie

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.021
and also sparkling water
which I don't like.

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:41.930
(Brooklyn and Betsy laugh)

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.207
So I feel so bad cause,

00:03:43.207 --> 00:03:44.730
"Oh, I'm okay, I really
just don't need a drink."

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.120
He was like, "Oh no, I
have water in the car."

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.020
So that's where he is right now.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.480
He's running to get me
water which I just...

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.010
Ah, I feel a little high
maintenance but that's okay.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.843
But that's the deal, feeling great.

00:03:51.843 --> 00:03:53.010
Having a fun time.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.940
Picnic Super fun.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.500
We're sitting on this cute little blanket

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.904
and Betsy is just chilling
just doing a great job.

00:03:58.904 --> 00:04:01.250
(people chattering)
(water ripples)

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.560
- [Betsy] Oh, that was good.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.800
- Hey everybody, watch and learn,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.292
the pro is about to start.

00:04:06.292 --> 00:04:09.303
(water ripples)

00:04:09.303 --> 00:04:12.070
(Matt screams)

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.162
- [Matt] Oh, nice!
- Oh it skipped.

00:04:14.162 --> 00:04:15.766
It's skipped twice.

00:04:15.766 --> 00:04:20.766
(water ripples)
(wind whirls)

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:24.688
Did I get three?

00:04:24.688 --> 00:04:25.646
- [Betsy] Mm, one.

00:04:25.646 --> 00:04:26.479
(Brooklyn and Betsy laugh)

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:27.312
- I think it was two.

00:04:27.312 --> 00:04:28.145
(screams)

00:04:28.145 --> 00:04:29.658
This is the second time
I've fallen on this date.

00:04:29.658 --> 00:04:30.677
- [Betsy] Oh my gosh (laughs).

00:04:30.677 --> 00:04:32.610
You guys, she ate it

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.970
and I didn't have the camera on.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.492
- And literally my face
touched the ground.

00:04:36.492 --> 00:04:37.790
(Brooklyn and Betsy laugh)

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.040
(water ripples)

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.020
- Nice, that was like five.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.110
That's pretty good.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.071
- That was pro, it's a bomb.

00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:47.030
- [Betsy] #pro right here.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.890
What else do we need to teach Brooklyn?

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:49.880
I mean, do you know at all?

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.276
All the things?

00:04:51.276 --> 00:04:53.840
- (chuckles) She knows
all the things already.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.713
- All of it.

00:04:54.713 --> 00:04:55.546
I'm a pro.

00:04:55.546 --> 00:04:56.379
- [Betsy] Paddle boarding now?

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:57.998
- I think that's the move.

00:04:57.998 --> 00:05:00.110
- What do you guys think
about these sunglasses?

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.109
- [Betsy] Turn to the sides.

00:05:01.109 --> 00:05:03.199
- Is that a go or a no go?

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.490
- Apparently, somebody thought

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.290
that they were girl sunglasses, right?

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.700
It's girls specific?
- Yeah.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.755
That guys don't wear
tinted shade sunglasses.

00:05:10.755 --> 00:05:14.200
- I thought that they were gender neutral.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.033
- Yeah.

00:05:15.033 --> 00:05:16.090
- [Brooklyn] Comment down
below what you think.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.960
- [Betsy] Should he keep them

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.005
or should he lose them?

00:05:18.005 --> 00:05:19.650
I think they look good.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.580
- [Brooklyn] Yeah, I think I like them.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.950
- [Betsy] He did find a picture
of Brad Pitt wearing some.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.528
- So maybe they are gender neutral.

00:05:26.528 --> 00:05:27.361
(Matt laughs)

00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:28.194
- [Betsy] I think so

00:05:28.194 --> 00:05:29.898
but I wanna hear what everyone else thinks

00:05:29.898 --> 00:05:30.731
- Yeah.

00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:33.898
(lively upbeat music)

00:05:36.698 --> 00:05:38.620
- [Betsy] Bye, have fun.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.030
Be safe.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.738
(lively upbeat music begins)

00:05:43.738 --> 00:05:45.911
(pop sound)

00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:48.744
(kids chattering)

00:05:57.231 --> 00:05:58.064
(pop sound)

00:05:58.064 --> 00:05:59.440
(lively upbeat music ends)

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.770
Okay, three, two, one jump.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.060
Three, two, one jump.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.410
- We were trying to take jumping pictures

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.720
and he lost his shoes in
the middle of the jump.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.427
So one is over here

00:06:11.427 --> 00:06:13.467
(foot steps approach)
(lively upbeat music)

00:06:13.467 --> 00:06:15.380
and the other one is over here.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.350
So he gave up (laughs).

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:17.795
He took his shoes off.

00:06:17.795 --> 00:06:18.628
- Just going with the bare feet.

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.400
- So we're gonna try and
get some more jumping photos

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.385
with bare feet this time (laughs).

00:06:22.385 --> 00:06:27.385

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.220
- [Betsy] First impression of Brooklyn.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.070
- I think she's super cute,

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.550
she's really fun.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.660
She is very easy to talk to.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.430
I feel like we got along pretty well,

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.250
had a lot to talk about.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.520
- [Betsy] Expect anything different or?

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.000
- I didn't really know what
to expect to be honest.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.200
I came in just kind of
blind ready for whatever

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.000
- [Betsy] And what--
- But it's been awesome.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.230
- [Betsy] Favorite part of the date?

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:10.440
Favorite part of the date

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.790
I think was the paddle boarding part.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:13.790
It's really pretty up here.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.360
It was fun to just kind of chat

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.220
and hang out on the paddle boards.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.570
- [Betsy] Awesome!
- Yeah.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.920
- [Betsy] What would you
rate the date one out of 10?

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.223
- 10 out of 10 for sure.

00:07:24.223 --> 00:07:25.056
It was awesome.

00:07:25.056 --> 00:07:26.460
- [Betsy] All good, awesome!

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.520
Thanks for the interview.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.353
- Yeah, you're welcome.

00:07:28.353 --> 00:07:30.610
- [Betsy] Brooklyn, first impression.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.250
- He was honestly so sweet.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.140
We got in the car

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.700
and it was just like so chill already.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.020
There's just no pressure.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.250
There's no stress.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.429
It was really easy.

00:07:38.429 --> 00:07:39.486
It was kind of nice.

00:07:39.486 --> 00:07:42.160
- [Betsy] Was it interesting
to go out with another twin?

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.520
Have you gone out with a twin before?

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.890
- I don't think I have.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:45.960
- [Betsy] First twin?

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.830
- This is the first time I've
gone out with another twin

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:48.850
but I think it's a little different

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:49.890
'cause he's a fraternal twin

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.400
and him and his twin are not the same.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.650
And so I don't know if they're like...

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.050
And they don't even do the same things.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.250
So it's a little different.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.060
So we talked about being
twins for like five minutes

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.370
but it honestly wasn't like any different

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.080
than going out with just
someone who isn't a twin

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.160
which I thought it would be

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.094
and it wasn't.

00:08:03.094 --> 00:08:03.927
Good to figure it.

00:08:03.927 --> 00:08:05.080
- [Betsy] Yeah and he's a pilot.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:05.940
- And he's a pilot

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.730
which I come from like
fifth generation pilots

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:09.200
so we connected on that.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.620
- [Betsy] That's awesome.
- Yeah.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.640
- [Betsy] And so just having fun tonight.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.160
- I know, it's been great.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.590
- [Betsy] You know what I
thought was so interesting

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.450
is he chose a chicken
caesar salad for dinner

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:19.820
and I thought that was like a good choice.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.010
I don't feel like guys
think of that I think.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:22.080
- I know it was super easy

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.130
and it was cooked really well.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:24.770
The chicken was delicious.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:25.603
I don't know if he made it,

00:08:25.603 --> 00:08:26.544
I don't know if he didn't,

00:08:26.544 --> 00:08:27.377
I don't know if bought it

00:08:27.377 --> 00:08:28.331
but it was really good.

00:08:28.331 --> 00:08:29.211
I ate the whole thing.

00:08:29.211 --> 00:08:30.557
- [Betsy] It doesn't matter.
- It doesn't matter (laughs).

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.823
We're at the end of the day.

00:08:34.923 --> 00:08:36.710
Thank you so much for taking me out.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.058
- Yeah, that was so much fun.
- Yeah, it was super fun.

00:08:39.058 --> 00:08:40.000
- Very nice to meet you.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.233
- Yeah good food, good time...

00:08:42.233 --> 00:08:43.210
- What I want you to know,

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.852
Brooklyn was so nice that
she offered to drive.

00:08:45.852 --> 00:08:48.330
- I did, I'm driving.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:49.760
Also, I just love this car.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.720
- But it was a fun date, right?

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.740
- Yeah, that was really creative.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.270
Like the picnic and the paddle boarding

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:55.830
and stuff all on the water there

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.070
'cause it's mountains here.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.810
Like in Texas, it's Lake water.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:08:59.650
Like with mud

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.060
and so it's always warm,

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:01.893
the ground is warm.

00:09:01.893 --> 00:09:04.110
Here, it's mountain water like snow.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.730
So even though it's hot outside,

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:06.810
it was freezing,

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:07.643
the water was freezing.

00:09:07.643 --> 00:09:08.920
Betsy wouldn't even touch her toe in it.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.430
She was like, "Nope, nope."

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.660
- Listen, I didn't want to...

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.240
I wanted them to have the fun.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.073
(laughs)

00:09:15.073 --> 00:09:16.350
I didn't want to take
away from your date, okay?

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.000
- So yeah, it was fun though.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.490
- Okay Brooklyn, I really wanna know,

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.017
how did you feel?

00:09:22.017 --> 00:09:23.500
Like do you feel...

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.310
You know you'll get that
feeling if he's the one.

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:28.000
- Yes.
- Did you get that feeling?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.130
- I don't think so.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.840
I think this guy was really nice

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.610
and the date was genuinely fun

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:37.150
but I'm so sure that
I'm just gonna feel it.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:38.540
I'm just gonna know

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.250
and I'm gonna wanna hang out more

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:41.490
and do all those things.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.790
And I don't know if this
is the person for that.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.040
He was so nice

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.834
but I just know I'm gonna feel it.

00:09:46.834 --> 00:09:49.250
- It's true, I think that really is true.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.083
Alyssa even said that.

00:09:50.083 --> 00:09:51.830
She's like, "I would go out with the guys

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:52.663
and they did all the perfect things.

00:09:52.663 --> 00:09:54.490
They were so nice.
- Yeah.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:55.323
- [Betsy] But...

00:09:55.323 --> 00:09:56.470
But if you guys loved him,

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:57.640
vote for him in the comments

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.200
because that can always help out.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.239
So...

00:10:01.239 --> 00:10:04.406
(lively brassy music)
